# Java-Swing-Memory-Card-Game

This was the final project for my intermediate Java programming course. The assignment was to make a card game, focusing on the 'object oriented' programming part of Java. 

The professor wanted it to be played through the IDE's terminal, but I thought that playing a card game through text like that would kinda stink, and I learned a bite about swing components from the previous class, so I studied swing components on my own so that I could use pictures for cards and have a color theme going and everything.

Looking back, I remember I had a really tough time making the cards 'check' eachother if they are equal, mainly because of the whole 'reference vs. value' idea, and I had a hard time to making the code work if buttons were pressed twice and similar QA and debugging problems. I had a really big vision of doing something beautiful with the whole stars and space theme, but like most projects, I was running out of time and had to struggle just to make it work by the deadline.

I was inspired by this game: https://sohun.itch.io/i-want-you-to-notice-me
I thought that the basic gameplay being engraved and woven so tightly to the story was profound and deep, and I wanted to do something like that. The author did another game similar: https://sohun.itch.io/i-want-to-remember-you but I felt that the story was kind of uninspired, and didn't really have a meaningful message. I had just watched a show called "Little Planetarian" that was about a robot that ran a tourist's observatory in the apocalypse, and how she taught one of the last human survivors how the stars guided humans through history. A similar feeling I wanted was from a game called "Mario Galaxy" which was a game in space about jumping around teeny little planets that even though they were small were full of life, like a bright warm fire in a world of darkness.

The game will have a meaningful story one day, but not until I'm inspired.
